# STATEMENT-ANALYSIS-WITH-NLP-TASK2

Explanation of the Project and Code
Project Overview: Sentiment Analysis
This project focuses on Sentiment Analysis, a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task where the goal is to determine the sentiment of a given text, such as whether a customer review is positive or negative.

In this implementation:

The model is trained using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text data into numerical features.
A Logistic Regression model is used to classify sentiments as positive or negative.
The results, including evaluation metrics, confusion matrix, and predictions, are presented in a web-based interface.
Code Explanation
HTML Structure
Head Section:

Includes metadata and CSS styles to structure and style the webpage.
Body Section:

Dataset Preview:
A table (id="dataset-preview") displays a preview of customer reviews and their sentiments.
Example rows are provided for demonstration.
Model Evaluation:
Displays the model's accuracy dynamically in a paragraph (id="accuracy").
Classification Report:
Shows precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each sentiment class in a <pre> tag.
Confusion Matrix:
A table (id="confusion-matrix") visualizes the model's performance in terms of True Negatives (TN), False Positives (FP), False Negatives (FN), and True Positives (TP).
Prediction:
A paragraph (id="prediction") displays the predicted sentiment for a new review.
CSS Styling
General Styling:

body: Sets a clean layout with margins and a modern font.
container: Limits the content width for better readability and centers it on the page.
Table and Pre Tag Styling:

Adds borders and padding to make the table easy to read.
Uses a light gray background for the classification report (<pre>) to give it a code-like appearance.
JavaScript Functionality
Dynamic Data Insertion:

Accuracy: The accuracy variable stores the model's accuracy percentage, which is dynamically inserted into the paragraph with id="accuracy".
Classification Report: The classificationReport variable contains the text output of the report, inserted into the <pre> tag.
Confusion Matrix: The confusionMatrix variable holds the matrix values, which populate the respective table cells dynamically.
Prediction: The prediction variable stores the sentiment prediction for a new review and is displayed in the paragraph with id="prediction".
Example Values:

The JavaScript uses placeholder data to simulate model results, including:
Accuracy: 92.47%
Confusion Matrix:
True Negatives: 135
False Positives: 15
False Negatives: 9
True Positives: 141
Example prediction: "Positive"
How It All Works Together
Input Data:

The dataset preview shows customer reviews with labeled sentiments.
A real-world implementation would replace the example rows with actual data from a server or file.
Model Output:

The accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix summarize how well the model performs.
The sentiment prediction showcases the model's ability to classify a new review.
Visualization:

The webpage organizes results neatly for easy interpretation by users or stakeholders.
Possible Enhancements
Interactivity:
Add a form to input new reviews dynamically for real-time sentiment prediction.
Dataset Upload:
Allow users to upload a dataset and view its sentiment analysis results.
Improved Styling:
Use a library like Bootstrap or custom CSS to enhance the design.
